##Dependencies
All tools used to build __todo__ can be found in most of the X (linux/unix) distributions, but just to let you know, I am using:

	gcc        C programing language compiler
	sed        powerful string pre-processor 
	awk        another powerful pre-processor

##Todos
Future features that I want to add to the project
